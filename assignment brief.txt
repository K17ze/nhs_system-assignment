This Part 2  of the assignment assesses the following module Learning Outcomes (from Definitive Module Document): 

Be able to define software architecture.  
Have knowledge and understanding of common software architecture patterns, Conway's law and its implications.  
Understand the advantages of a three-tier architecture.  
Be able to apply common software architecture patterns to design systems and to describe a system architecture using common modelling notation. ✔ 
Be able to implement a system using a three−tier architecture. ✔ 
Be able to use the Model-View-Controller pattern to design a user interface. ✔ 
Consider the scenario provided in part 1, and the design models you created as part of your submission for part 1. This part 2, builds on your work on part 1.

 

Your deliverables:

You’re to implement your designs using the Java programming language. In particular, ensure the classes in your class diagram (part 1) are realised in your implementation. You are to use plain Java, no database technology , JavaFX or any plugin-based external libraries.  You’re provided with input data files which you can use to demonstrate functionality of your application. For example, if you load patients records, clinicians dataset, appointments, then you can produce prescriptions. A prescription file is provided also, into which you should be able to insert additional prescription records.  

You should structure your codebase using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. You are to use the Singleton design pattern within the referral management functionality. The Singleton pattern ensures single instance creation of critical system components, preventing resource conflicts and maintaining data consistency across referral processes. 

The referral system implementation should leverage the Singleton pattern to manage referral queues, email communications, and electronic health record updates. This approach ensures consistent referral processing, prevents duplicate communications, and maintains proper audit trails throughout the referral lifecycle.

Your application should be accessed through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using standard classes available in the Java Swing package.

Please note that, it is not expected that your application should send real emails, rather, generate text content that you can persist in a file to depict what would constitute a referral. 

Develop your application incrementally and iteratively, ensuring to use git to do regular commits of your work. A commit log will be part of your deliverables.

For undergraduate modules:
a score of 40% or above represents a pass performance at honours level. 
late submission of any item of coursework for each day or part thereof (or for hard copy submission only, working day or part thereof) for up to five days after the published deadline, coursework relating to modules at Levels 0, 4, 5, 6 submitted late (including deferred coursework, but with the exception of referred coursework), will have the numeric grade reduced by 10 grade points until or unless the numeric grade reaches or is 40. Where the numeric grade awarded for the assessment is less than 40, no lateness penalty will be applied.

Criteria	Ratings	Points
Functionality
25 to >20 pts
Outstanding
Application has no compile time issues, loads data files, creates new records (new patient, new prescription, new referral); Contents of output text file (referrals and prescription content ) indicate new records are able to be added to them and can persist. No file i/o exceptions especially while writing to files
20 to >17 pts
Excellent
There are no compile time issues; Data files are loading but file paths are not managed well, ability to create new records (new patient, new prescription, new referral) is there; New records are either added to original files or to new output text files (referrals and prescription content ) and they persist; there are some exceptions raised when writing to one or more of the files.
17 to >15 pts
Very good
No compilation issues, loading some data files has issues, creating new records (new patient, new prescription, new referral) is fine but not for all of these main ones (patients, referrals, prescriptions); Writing to file is raising exceptions but records are shown on the console when written
15 to >10 pts
Good
No compile time issues, but there are runtime exceptions to do with file reading and writing; some output files are written to, with some raising exceptions
10 to >8 pts
Satisfactory
Compile time issues but application still runs; loads datasets and writes some data to output files; there are file i/o exceptions; file paths not managed well; also some of the output is not persisting to files but is shown on the console
8 to >4 pts
Failing
There source code has significant compilation issues; file paths aren't managed well; loading files and creating new records not possible

20 to >17 pts
Excellent
singleton pattern is well used for referral object or another object of choice that shows suitable use of this pattern; Excellent structuring of application classes using MVC; there lacks obvious organisation of application source files into clear M, V, C categories
17 to >15 pts
Very good
Structuring of application classes using MVC is there but required more clarity on the classes that comprise each of M, V and C. Singleton pattern attempted but not full used.
15 to >10 pts
Good
One of the two patterns and not the other is used; either hardly any use of MVC but singleton implemented, or hardly any use of singleton but MVC implemented.
10 to >8 pts
Satisfactory
Both patterns are attempted but not fully implemented; e.g, M, and V classes have not been glued together using the C
8 to >4 pts
Failing
No explicit use of MVC, but codebase is organised in a way that appreciation of MVC, no use of singleton

13 to >10 pts
Good
Datasets are loading fine, new records are created but writing to files is raising file i/o issues. Also, loading files is an issue due to file paths not being addressed in advance of submitting the work
